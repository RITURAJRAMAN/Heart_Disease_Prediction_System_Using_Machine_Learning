# Heart_Disease_Prediction_System_Using_Machine_Learning
## A Web Application to predict either a person is suffering from Heart Disease or Not.

### Heart disease is the major reason for death. Heart disease detection is the major issue which leads to death, if the disease is detected earlier then the proper cure can be done and the patient can be saved.
In this project a model has been trained which is further used to deploy a website application on cloud.
